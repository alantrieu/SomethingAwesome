# Something Awesome
My Something Awesome project for COMP6441

This was a personal challenge project, where students picked topics related to security which interested them. 
My project revolved around learning basic CTF concepts and applying them through various wargames, most notably, [Natas](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/).

*documentationSubmission.pdf* is the 4-page report that was submitted for grading. It summaries my learning goals, methodology, challenges and reflection. It also includes the links to my original blogs on OpenLearning, a Google doc which documented my journey with Natas, as well my video submission (a copy is provided here as *videoSubmission.mp4*).

*wargame-blogs.pdf* is a 64-page rewritten compilation of wargame blogs which documented my thought-process and challenges trying to complete them, along with the weekly reflection blogs. The aforementioned links to the original blogs requires you to create an OpenLearning account. This PDF is an alternative to that.

And in case you don't want to download the report submission, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMZVjS3DD0U) is the presentation video.

Final grade: 90%
